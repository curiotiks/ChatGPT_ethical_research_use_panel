# The When Before the How

Ethical and Practical Boundaries of AI in Academic Research Writing

## Overview

This project examines the **ethical and practical boundaries** of AI-generated text in academic research writing. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT streamline research workflows—supporting literature searches, summarization, and data analysis—they also raise unresolved questions about **accountability, fairness, and academic integrity**.

The project highlights both opportunities and concerns:

- **Opportunities**: Efficiency gains and support for non-native English speakers (NNES), who make up a large share of global researchers but face linguistic disadvantages.
- **Concerns**: Authorship, responsible use, and ethical red lines in research publishing.

## Research Questions

1. Does the availability of ChatGPT devalue the skill of academic writing?  
2. When does the use of AI in research writing become unethical?  
3. What factors most influence the boundary between ethical and unethical use?

## Scope

The panel discussion and project focus on:

- **Contexts**: Journal articles, conference papers, grant proposals, and dissertations.  
- **Exclusions**: Coursework-related writing, which falls under different pedagogical considerations.  

## Panel Format

The project uses a **scenario-based, interactive panel format**:

1. **Opening Remarks** – Framing the scope and objectives.  
2. **Structured Discussion Cycle** (50 min):  
   - Scenario introduced by moderator (based on Rowland’s human–AI writing continuum).  
   - Audience votes on ethical acceptability via Google Forms.  
   - Panelists discuss without seeing poll results.  
   - Audience re-polls to capture opinion shifts.  
3. **Closing Reflections** – Panelist insights, key takeaways, and audience polling summary.
