Scenario ID,Level(s),Title,Description,Ethical Question
A1,3–4 (AI as Critic/Planner),Journal Article Revision,"A research team receives “major revision” feedback. Before rewriting, they paste the entire results section into ChatGPT and ask for suggestions on how to reorganize the argument for clarity and logical flow. They use some structural suggestions and rephrase transitions but do not insert AI-generated sentences.",Is this appropriate professional editing or unethical outsourcing of intellectual effort?
A2,3–4 (AI as Critic/Planner),Dissertation Chapter Organization,"A PhD candidate uses ChatGPT to generate possible subheadings for their discussion chapter, based on a brief summary of findings. The AI provides a list of themes, which the student adapts into an outline before writing all text independently.",Is the AI’s role as a “thinking assistant” compatible with academic authorship?
B1,5–6 (AI as Drafter/Paraphraser),Literature Review Drafting,"A doctoral student compiles annotated notes summarizing 30 studies. They paste the notes into ChatGPT with the prompt, “Turn these into a coherent literature review section (APA style).” The AI produces a rough draft that the student revises for flow and accuracy before submission.","Does this still represent the student’s synthesis, or has authorship meaningfully shifted?"
B2,5–6 (AI as Drafter/Paraphraser),Methods Paraphrasing,"A non-native English-speaking researcher copies sentences from prior publications describing standard procedures and asks ChatGPT to paraphrase them to avoid plagiarism. They integrate those paraphrased sentences into their paper, citing the original methods appropriately.",Is this legitimate linguistic assistance or an ethical gray area of “AI laundering”?
C1,7 (AI as Conversational Co-author),Abstract Co-writing,"A researcher pastes sections of their completed paper into ChatGPT and iteratively refines a 250-word abstract through multiple prompt-and-revise cycles (“make it more concise,” “emphasize novelty”). The final abstract is heavily shaped by AI phrasing, though all information originates from the author’s study.","Should this count as legitimate editing support, or does it obscure AI authorship in a published work?"
C2,7 (AI as Conversational Co-author),Conceptual Framework Development,Two scholars developing a theoretical framework feed ChatGPT a long exchange about their ideas and ask it to summarize and refine their emerging argument. They copy portions of the AI’s phrasing directly into the manuscript draft.,"Has the AI crossed the threshold from tool to co-author, and how should that be acknowledged?"
